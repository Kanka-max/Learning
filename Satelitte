### About EarthPy

EarthPy is a python package that makes it easier to plot and work with spatial raster and vector data using open source tools.
Depends upon geopandas which has a focus on vector data and rasterio with facilitates input and output of raster data files. 
It also requires matplotlib for plotting operations.

### About Remote Sensing.

#### Image Classification in Remote Sensing
- Process of of assigning land cover classes to pixels. eg.water, urban, forest, agriculture and grassland
[ImageClassification](https://gisgeography.com/image-classification-techniques-remote-sensing/)
- Three types of image classification:
  - Supervised image classification.
  - Unsupervised image classification.
  - Object-based image analysis.

### GeoPandas 0.9.0
- GeoPandas is an open source project to make working with geospatial data in python easier.
- Extends the datatypes used by pandas to allow spatial operations on geometric types.
- Geometric operations are performed by shapely.
- Geopandas further depends on fiona for file access and matplotlib for plotting.
